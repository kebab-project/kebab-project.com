Revolution Start
================

We start the revolution. Join or die!

After two years, Kebab Core Team decided to develop new version of Kebab Project v.2.x which nickname Kebab Revolution.
Everything is almost changed. Not only the technologies but also the development methodology. That's why this is a revolution.

Why this is a revolution?

* We use Ruby language and Ruby on Rails framework at server side.
* We use Ext Js 4.0 so we have a native mvc structure come from Ext Js.
* We start to develop TDD. We write all test over v.2.x.
* Kebab 2.x supports multi-tenant applications.
* Kebab is designed for cloud, cdn systems.

You can see the all discussion requests about v.2.x at the link <http://kebab-project.2299591.n4.nabble.com/Kebab-2-0-Features-Request-Discussion-td3864746.html>

What about v.1.5.x? Of course we continue to support v.1.5.x.

Best Regards.
